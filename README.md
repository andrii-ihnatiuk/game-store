# GameStore

A project created during the .NET Laboratory mentoring program at EPAM Systems.

It is an e-commerce application for computer games. The system consists of several parts:

1. ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 6)

2. Angular application

3. Payment microservice

4. Authentication microservice
   
   

Some key features of the system:

- Azure Blob storage integration for static content

- Azure Service Bus integration for sending Email, SMS messages.

- Localization of UI and domain entities

- Work with 2 databases (SQL Server + MongoDb). Northwind database is used to simulate legacy or third-party data storage so that our system introduces some compatibility features.

- Some caching implemented on the backend

- Email sending using SMTP service

- Logging using NLog

- System test coverage 50%

- Validation using FluentValidation

- Error handling

- Generation of thumbnails for images to improve load speed



Below are demo videos showing some of the functionality of the system.
